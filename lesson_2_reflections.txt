What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
When I initialize a repository git creates diferents folders. I need to do it
for tracking my work.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?
The working directory is a single checkout of one version of the project. This
essentially means if I checkout a branch (e.g. master) and are sat on a
particular commit (e.g. HEAD), my working directory is the "umbrella" term for
all my files and folders.
The staging area is best described as a preview of my next commit.
The value I think it offers is that it allows me to fine-tune my commits.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
change?

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history
organized? How would branches help?

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in
the diagram the way we do?

What are the pros and cons of Git's automatic merging vs. always doing merges
manually?
